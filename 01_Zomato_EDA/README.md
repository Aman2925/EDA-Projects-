# 🍽️ Zomato Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Zomato restaurant dataset** to understand restaurant distribution, customer rating behavior, engagement patterns, and country-level characteristics.
The objective is to transform raw data into **actionable insights** that can support **data-driven decision-making and dashboard development**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand the structure and key attributes of the dataset
* Analyze **country-wise restaurant distribution**
* Examine **customer rating patterns and engagement**
* Identify **countries with zero ratings**
* Study **currency usage across different countries**
* Derive **business-ready analytical insights**

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

The dataset was cleaned and prepared to ensure reliable analysis:

* Checked and handled missing and zero values in rating-related columns
* Verified and corrected data types for numerical and categorical features
* Ensured consistency across country, currency, and rating fields
* Filtered and grouped data to support accurate country-level analysis

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

* **Country-wise Distribution Analysis**
  Identified dominant markets and geographic concentration of restaurants.

* **Rating Classification & Engagement Analysis**
  Categorized ratings (Excellent to Average) to evaluate customer satisfaction and engagement levels.

* **Zero Rating Analysis**
  Identified countries with zero ratings, highlighting regions with low engagement or newly listed restaurants.

* **Currency Analysis**
